### Example of the Prototype Design Pattern using Copy Constructors

This example of the prototype design pattern was develop using C# language.

In this example, we learn a new way of copying an object. We create constructors that receive an instance of its type, using itâ€™s properties to fill out a new object. When we have properties that are objects themselves, we need to create these copy constructors on those types as well.
